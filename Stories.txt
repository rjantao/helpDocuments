  Logic explains , stories persuade 
  
 Why?


How do you find a story?


Steps to create a story 
  Scene : time and place 
  The journey 
  Introduce the character 
     The main character 
     They find allies 
      Life is better in the end of the day


Enconter the obstacle 
Overcoming the obstacule 
   What do you do ?
   What options do you have?
    What choices do you have?


Resolve the story 
Make the point 
Ask the question 

Science 
    You have hide the pill like you have to do we your dog   


   Too much content
   Too much data
   Too much to swallow  




Stories are products 


Recall a movie story from your childhood
See the childhood memory
